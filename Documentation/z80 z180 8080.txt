p	These pseudo instructions declare the type of processor and assembler syntax in use. They are equivalent to the command line options --z80, --z180 and --asm8080. These instructions overload the command line options. (Command line options will have no effect.) They must occur befor the first 'org' instruction or segment definition.

h5	Target cpu z80
pre		.z80
p	Declare the source to be for a Z80. This is the default, so it is normally never required.

h5	Target cpu z180
pre		.z180
p	Declare the source to be for a Z180 or HD64180. 
p	The additional instructions are enabled and all illegal instructions are disabled.

h5	Target Intel 8080
pre		.8080
p	Declare the source to be for a Intel 8080 cpu. This also selects 8080 assembler syntax and case folding for label names.
