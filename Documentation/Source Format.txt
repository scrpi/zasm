h2	Source Format
	zasm expects your source to be either 7-bit ascii or utf-8 encoded. Line ending should be '\n'.
	
p	ZASM supports the typical layout for Z80 assembler source files, that is, it expects one instruction per line. Comments start with a semicolon ";" and label definitions start in column 1. Assembler directives start with a hash "#" in column 1.
p	Though not strictly required it is recommended to declare the target and to define at least one code segment as shown below.

h5	Example file:
pre	; example file
	#target rom					; our target is a rom or eprom
	#code   rom, 0, 0x4000		; define a code segment of 16kB with name 'rom'
			org		0			; set logical code address (redundant)
			
	RESET	di					; define label 'RESET' and opcode 'DI' at that address
			ld		sp,8000h	; next is opcode to set the stack pointer: 'LD SP,8000h'
			jp		_init_code	; resume system start somewhere
			defs	8-$			; RST8 must start at address 8 => add required space
	RST8	jp		_rst_8		; jump somewhere
			defs	16-$		; RST16 must start at address 16 => add required space
	; ...
